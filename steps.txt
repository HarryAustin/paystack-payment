1) CREATE AN AUTHNETICATION(ANYONE, PREFARABLY SESSION AUTH)
2) AN ITEM ROUTE THAT CONTAINS ITEM TO BUY SINCE IT'S NOT A FULL FEATURED E-COMMERCE SITE
3) THE ITEM ROUTE CONTAINS PRICE AND NAME OF PRODUCT.
// Basically what we are doing is that we are creating a very small minified version of an ecommerce because of it's payment
// integration, so we just have a small store that sells only one product.
4) After Creating everything both with paystack, we save some info a DB for us to have evidence of transactions

So what we do, is that we create an account, or log in with an account. Then we buy an item then we proceed to checkout and be redirected to paystack section.
