my modal accepts data in form of 

{
    img: "images/image-product-1.jpg",
    title: "Autumn Limited Edition",
    price: 125.0,
    count: 3,
}

and this will have to work with the backend.



Let's say for a product, we have info like price, name, and images url,

we can have this

{
    name: ....,
    price: ....,
    images: [....]
}
